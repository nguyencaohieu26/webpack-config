Webpack Note:

- Entry: An entry point indicates which module webpack should use to begin building out its internal dependency graph. Webpack will figure out which other modules and libraries that entry point depends on (directly or indirectly).
- Output: The output property tells webpack where to emit the bundles it crates and how to name these files. It defaults to ./dist/main.js for the main output file and to the ./ folder for any other generated file.
